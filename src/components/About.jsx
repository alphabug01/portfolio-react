              With 5 years of experience building full-stack applications, I've learned that the best code serves its
              users — not the other way around. I'm an Assistant Manager in IT at IFFCO Tokio, where I build systems
              that real people depend on every day.

              I almost went to design school for interaction design. I didn't follow through — but that instinct never
              left. It shows up in how I think about every interface, every flow, every decision. I care about UX not
              as a buzzword, but as a responsibility.

              Currently expanding my craft into React, Next.js, and Node.js — because good tools make good design
              possible.
